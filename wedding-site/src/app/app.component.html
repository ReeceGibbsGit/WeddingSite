    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      It was 2020 when we first met at a party while Georgia was meant to be
      studying for a psychology test. Sparks flew instantly when Reece impressed
      her with his banter, and plans were made to meet up again the next
      weekend. Frustratingly, the world then went into lockdown, forcing some
      rather inventive covert rendezvous. It was in this time of texting (until
      3am some mornings) that we discovered a mutual love of deep chats over
      good coffee, a passion for travel, and surprisingly complementary tastes
      in music.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since then our love has grown, with our life adventure finally ending up
      with us both living in New Zealand, after a year of being 12 000km apart.
      Going from long-distance movie dates, managing time zones and visas; we
      now spend our time exploring hiking trails, trying out new recipes, and
      finding the best spots for cocktail sundowners.
      <br />
      <br />
      In August, Reece proposed to Georgia who has still not stopped staring at
      the stunning ring he designed for her. Another design of his is this
      website you are currently reading: he coded it all from scratch (and
      Georgia thinks it's brilliant)! We are beyond excited to start this new
      chapter by celebrating our love and future together with all of our
      favourite people!

    <h2>The Venue</h2>
    <p>
      We will be celebrating the first day of our marriage at Haycroft Farm,
      located in The KZN Midlands.
      <br />
      <br />
      Weather-permitting, the ceremony will be held in the Forest Chapel; a
      breath-taking clearing under the forest canopy, overlooking the water.
      <br />
      <br />
      Thereafter, drinks, canapes, and cake will be enjoyed on the deck before
      heading to the reception for festivities.

      first-come-first-serve basis.

    <h2>Getting to the Venue</h2>
    <p>
      From the N3:
      <br />
      Take Exit 107 towards Tweedie
      <br />
      Turn right onto R103
      <br />
      After &#177;1km, turn right onto P162 (this is easy to miss)
      <br />
      Continue straight for &#177;4km (travelling over the N3)
      <br />
      Turn left into Haycroft
      <br />
      <br />
      <i

    <h2>Gifts</h2>
    <p>
      Following all of our celebrations we have a long flight ahead of us back
      to New Zealand - and not all that much luggage space. For that reason, we
      ask that you please refrain from purchasing any physical gifts for us and
      rather contribute to a little fund to help pay for our future travels.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you wish to do so, please deposit an amount of your choosing into the
      bank account below and ensure to leave your full name in the payment
      reference so we can thank you.
